ZmanBar is a GNOME Shell extension written in modern JavaScript (ESM) for the GJS environment. It integrates with core GNOME components by modifying the existing clock and calendar menu labels (`St.Label`) to include the Hebrew date. Date calculations are handled by an adapted version of the `jewish-date` library.
